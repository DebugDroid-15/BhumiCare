# BhumiCare

A responsive IoT-based web dashboard designed for **real-time monitoring of agricultural field conditions** using an **ESP32** microcontroller and multiple environmental sensors.  
This dashboard displays **live sensor data** such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, EC (electrical conductivity), LDR (light intensity), and more ‚Äî helping farmers and researchers make **data-driven decisions**.
